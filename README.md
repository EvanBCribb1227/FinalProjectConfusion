# FinalProjectConfusion 
The Project is designed to grade a student's exam .txt file 
by being converted to a String[] and compared to a Solutions .txt file and returned to fit inside the Exam object class.
The problem is that it's saying the String[] that holds the folder of each student's .txt file is null and can't read the String[].length for the for loop
This problem occurs on line 78 in the Teacher class
